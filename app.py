Answer: Yes. Where the licensed corporation (or registered institution) is also an associated entity, a single notification for the same change in information is acceptable provided that the capacities under which the notification is made is clearly stated.

**Question: Can a licensed corporation that is also an associated entity make a single submission of financial statements?**
Answer: Yes. A single submission by a licensed corporation that is also an associated entity is acceptable provided that the submission complies with the requirements under the Accounts and Audit Rules for a licensed corporation and states the capacities of the corporation.
