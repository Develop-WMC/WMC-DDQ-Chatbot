### Compliance, Audit & Risk

**Question: Does your Company have any legal, regulatory or internal control procedures to ensure confidentiality of information about clients, handle conflicts of interests with clients, or implement the code of ethics?**
Answer: Yes, we have legal, regulatory or internal control procedures for these purposes.

**Question: Please confirm that the Company has established, implemented and maintain a compliance monitoring program, i.e. how does it ensure that your Compliance manual is followed by all of its employees.**
Answer: All employees are required to attend Compliance Training Sessions held by Management to ensure that they understand the legal and compliance issues involved related to their positions, and the standards and practices expected of them by the Company and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. All staffs are tested on the materials of the Compliance Manual to ensure competence. Controls are set up to govern all essential procedures with strict observation of compliance requirements, and all Management are required to ensure the established control and policies are executed with prudence by all staffs.

**Question: How often is the Compliance Manual reviewed/audited?**
Answer: The Compliance manual is reviewed periodically as new practices and regulations are enacted by governing authorities in Hong Kong and worldwide.

**Question: What is the scope and frequency of the Company’s compliance review function?**
Answer: Our compliance review function covers all areas of our business as a fund platform. This would span all essential areas from the execution of orders, handling of clients’ assets, anti-money laundering and know-your-client requirements, code of conduct, staff dealing policies, sales practices, due diligence on products, providers, clients and sub-distributors, third-party service providers, internal control, to our IT infrastructure and security. All areas are constantly reviewed upon the addition or renewal of standards and practices as updated circulars, regulations, or guidelines are published.

**Question: Does your Company have an internal audit function or other independent third party that assesses your internal control policies and practices on a regular basis?**
Answer: We do not have an internal audit function. However, we have an external audit to review our policies and practices annually. The last review was conducted in April 2024 by D & Partners CPA Limited. There were no material findings.

**Question: Please provide the contact details of the Internal Audit Officer.**

### Business Model & Procedures

**Question: describe the Company’s business and procedure**
Answer: Our business model is B-B-C and we do not accept retail or individual clients directly. All retail clients are directed to opening an account with an IFA of their choice. All IFAs must go through our due diligence process. As a fund platform, normally all funds available are accessed when the consultants of the IFA login to their accounts. For unauthorized funds, only Professional Investors, who have declared themselves to being such, have access to this section.

**Question: distribution of our funds by electronic or other non-face-to-face means?**
Answer: All funds are normally distributed through Cube 2, our fund distribution platform, where users / consultants of our client investors login and select their desired funds for the portfolio of their end-investors.

**Question: responsible for suitability testing on investors.**
Answer: As an execution-only platform, we are generally product neutral and do not recommend investment products. As such, we generally rely on our sub-distribution partners to carry out suitability testing for their end-investors. However, WMC does ensure unauthorized funds will only be distributed to Professional Investors (PI). The platform has features to assist in suitability, such as comparing a fund's risk rating to the client's risk profile and generating a system alert if a fund's risk is higher.

**Question: Internal process for the review and approval of new fund products to be distributed**
Answer: Yes, for Hong Kong authorized funds, we follow our usual onboarding procedure including due diligence on the product and product provider, risk-rating assessment, and approval. For Hong Kong unauthorized funds, we require the IFA to supply a formal request, and we then apply our normal due diligence and internal approval process.

### Outsourcing & Third Parties

- **For FE Fundinfo (fund data):** Our due diligence includes evaluation of the operating history, reputation, and compliance record. We also look at their internal procedures and control in assuring data quality. Annual Reviews are also carried out.

**Question: the Company’s oversight process of the outsourced tasks and/or processes.**
Answer:

**Question: Are sub-distributors required to make you aware of any relevant complaints?**
Answer: Our sub-distributors are SFC licensed corporations. We regularly monitor the enforcement announcements on the SFC website to see if there are any matching cases. They are under regulatory oversight with annual audits. If we see an enforcement case related to the sub-distributor, we would request them to address our concern and enhance their internal controls.

### Policies & Procedures

**Question: Conflicts of interest**
Answer: Any conflicts of interest should be properly managed and minimized to ensure that clients are fairly treated. The duties of the sales function and front-office are properly segregated from back-office operations. We will disclose any material interest in a transaction to the client and have taken all reasonable steps to ensure fair treatment. We also have detailed policies on Gifts and Entertainment, Working for Competitors, Use of Company Assets, Dealing with Suppliers, and Bribery.

**Question: Inducements**
Answer: The Company considers it paramount to act fairly and professionally. Generally, staff are not allowed to receive benefits from any third parties, or make payments to the same, except for limited provisions in the Gift and Entertainment Policies which must be reported. All charges are separately itemized for clients.

**Question: the key features of the Company’s remuneration process.**
Answer: Remuneration to our staff is generally salary-based, and is determined based on experience and merit, such that our employees would not benefit from compromising the interests of our clients. Remuneration is based on an unbundled, separate compensation and is unrelated to any specific product on our platform.

**Question: Investor complaints handling**
Answer: Complaints from clients must be handled by Senior Management. All information received shall be kept confidential and a register of complaints should be kept. We must investigate and respond promptly. Where a complaint cannot be remedied promptly, the client must be advised of further steps available, including the right to refer a dispute to the FDRC. All files of complaints must be kept for at least 7 years.

Answer: Sales are recruited based on both qualifications and experience. All sales representatives are licensed and are subject to the annual SFC Continuous Professional Training (CPT) requirements. They are also required to receive on-the-job training and training sessions regarding professional skills, sales, and compliance knowledge.

### AML, KYC, CFT

**Question: The process in place for AML screening at investor level.**
Answer: Name scan is performed to ascertain the identity of prospective investors and to determine if an investor falls into high-risk categories such as a Politically Exposed Person (PEP). This action is aided by the use of Dow Jones’ Factiva as our name search engine. In addition, periodic screenings are also performed against international sanction lists and PEPs as stipulated by the Hong Kong SFC.

**Question: AML, KYC, CFT**
Answer: We observe closely the SFC's “Know-Your-Clients” requirements. We perform formal checking on our FI partners and a second-tier KYC on the end-investors. For our FI clients, we require standard documents like Certificate of Incorporation, Business Registration, etc. For end-investors, we verify their identity, FATCA & CRS status, integrity, and risk profile. We use a third-party system for name scanning to identify high-risk individuals (e.g., PEPs) and perform Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) on them. Annual AML/CTF training sessions are conducted for all staff.

### IT, Cybersecurity, BCP & Record Keeping
